# ASPNET-Week-2

Using the week 1 example, I added a button on the product page called "Duplicate" that takes the selected product and duplicates all information except the Primary Key "ID" to avoid conflicts. 

Added interface "IDuplicate"

Added class/service "DuplicateService"





Added scoped Iduplicate and DuplicateService to the builder
